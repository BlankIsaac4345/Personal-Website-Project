            Soccer is my main hobbya and I love playing it.
            I mostly like playijng soccer to clear my mind or just have fun.
            I love when i play with frinds because it become competetive and harder but its fun to be challenged.
            Soccer has helped me alot when im mad, confused, or annoyed I am able to take it out on the ball and feel better.
            But some day i would love to go pro but thats if i put effort.
