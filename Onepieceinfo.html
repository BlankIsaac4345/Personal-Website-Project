    <p>
        I really like Bonclay for many reasons but im going to name 3 important reaseons.
        Number 1 Bonclay is an overall funny goofy character that no one can really hate.
        Number 2 he's a l=very loyal companion to have by your side no matter how crazy your goals are he will be there helping you.
        3rd and final reason while helping the main character Luffy try to save his brother Bonclay stayed at the prison to free Luffy but he sacrifised himself for Luffy.
